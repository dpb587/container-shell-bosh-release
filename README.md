# container-shell-bosh-release

For managing users whose shell will drop them into a container.

Unlike os-conf-release, it doesn't manage `authorized_keys` and users cannot access a system shell. You probably want this in connection with [ssoca-bosh-release](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca-bosh-release) providing a SSH service.
